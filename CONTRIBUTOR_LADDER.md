# gittuf Contributor ladder

gittuf's contributor ladder is loosely inspired by the OpenSSF [Scorecard
Contributor Ladder]. This document details how community members may advance to
more-involved roles within the gittuf project.

## Roles

### Community members

Community members engage with gittuf, contributing their time and energy in
discussions or just generally helping out.

#### Pre-requisites

- Must follow the [OpenSSF Code of Conduct]
- Must follow the [Contribution Guide]

#### Responsibilities

### Maintainers

Maintainers are responsible for the project's overall health. They are the only
ones who can approve and merge code contributions.

**Defined by:** Listed in the `MAINTAINERS.txt` file in the project repository

#### Pre-requisites

- Reviewed at least 5 substantial PRs to the codebase
- Reviewed or got at least 30 PRs merged to the codebase

#### Responsibilities

- Maintain project quality control via code reviews
- Be responsive to review requests
- Mentor contributors
- Participate in gittuf community meetings, if possible
- Facilitate gittuf community meetings, if possible and comfortable

#### Promotion process

- Sponsored by a maintainer
    - With no objections from other maintainers
    - Done through PR to update the `MAINTAINERS.txt` file
- May self-nominate or be nominated by a maintainer
    - In case of self-nomination, sponsor must comment approval on the PR

## Inactive members

A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active
participation. It is inevitable that a contributor's focus will change over time
and there is no expectation they'll actively contribute forever.

Any contributor at any level described above may write an issue (or PR, if
`MAINTAINERS.txt` changes are necessary) asking to step down to a lighter-weight
tier or to depart the project entirely. Such requests will hopefully come after
thoughtful conversations with the rest of the team and with sufficient
forewarning for the others to prepare. However, sometimes "life happens".
Therefore, the change in responsibilities will be understood to take immediate
effect, regardless of whether the issue/PR has been acknowledged or merged.

However, should a Maintainer be deemed inactive for a significant period, any
Community Member or above may write an issue/PR requesting their removal from
the ranks (and `@mentioning` the inactive contributor in the hopes of drawing
their attention). The request must receive support (in comments) from a majority
of Maintainers to proceed.

In all cases, the maintainer's entry in `MAINTAINERS.txt` file will be updated
to reflect their emeritus status.
