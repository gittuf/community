Our logo represents us as an project and how we relate with the broader technical landscape. It is important that it is always used the right way so that people are able to identify us at a glance. For that reason we have it in many formats. In this repo, we have artwork in standard formats PNG & SVG and at least 3 versions (color/black/white).

Please note that although PNG is more common, SVG file sizes are smaller, supported in all modern web browsers, and a high-resolution format suitable for both print and high-resolution computer screens.
